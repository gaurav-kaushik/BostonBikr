The Tam
"Love The Tam"
"Sunday evening visit. Great atmosphere and service. Pizza place right next door if you need to fill up with great selection. Prices are reasonable and if you really want to save $$ a local canned beer is available. "
Fenway Park
"Checked on off the bucket list!"
"Visited as part of a New England family vacation. Fun atmosphere including outside the park! Street lined with eating and drinking venues. Inside the park there are REAL baseball fans who do not get up during innings or leave multiple times during a game like they do in my hometown, Seattle. Bought ..." More >
Freedom Trail
"You're never to old to learn something new about our nation's history"
"Liked that you could go at your own pace and stop for refreshments, especially on a hot summer day. A good refresher on our nation's history. Wear comfortable shoes! "

Sacco's Bowl Haven
"Best flatbread pizza around"
"Had their flatbread pizza last year at an outside venue in Davis Sq. (Artbeat) blew me away, We have been back a few times since, will gladly return."
The Outlets at Assembly Row
"Nice variety of stores with parking!"
"My friend & I visited Assembly Row yesterday and were impressed with the outlets. The store we visited (Banana Republic, Express, Nike...etc) had way more of a variety than the Merrimack Outlets that we visited last week. It would've been nice to see another dessert/ice cream place besides just JP L..." More >
Sacco's Bowl Haven
"Fun times and good food"
"My friends all surprised me for my 19th birthday by taking me here. It is a great place for a celebration like that. It is a charming little bowling ally with candle pin bowling, as the New Englanders like, along with flat bread pizzas. The pizzas were good and the bowling was fun, as it was my firs..." More >
Sacco's Bowl Haven
"From old school townie place, to Hipster central"
"I can't say I spent much time in Sacco's when it was our old school bowling alley, but a part of me hates to see the old places go the way of hipster heaven....Which Sacco's has. That said, the food is very tasty and fresh. We go from time to time, last night was a fund raiser for the Nave Gallery a..." More >
Museum of Bad Art
"Wonky sort of Museum"
"I think it is very good in a wonky sort of way. Some of the stuff is HORRIBLE. But I guess that is what it is."
Davis Square
"Once the media calls it hip, it's no longer hip. But it's still fun."
"Davis Square is a popular Somerville neighborhood - particularly with the college crowd. It has a nice diverse mix of good restaurants, bars, clubs, funky neighborhood cinema (including MOBA - Museum Of Bad Art), eclectic shopping and a lively vibe. The streets are alive after 5, especially on weeke..." More >
Legoland Discovery Center
"Lego!"
"I was skeptical after reading reviews on whether we were going to make the stop here on our trip to Boston,I am glad we did, my 10 yr old Lego nut loved it! We rode the kingdom ride several times, did the master builder academy, ( which would have been better if the builder did not have to deal with..." More >
Legoland Discovery Center
"Everything was Awesome at Legoland"
"My kids had a ball on a cold rainy day. So much to do and so much fun. The area is fantastic too with outlet shops and great eats. A fun day for the whole family."
Taza Chocolate Factory Tours
"Great tour to bring an out of town friend"
"I was looking for something to bring a friend visiting from Canada and this tour was a great find. The chocolate is delicious and the tour guide is informative. Also they have a great gift shop for grabbing souvenirs."
Davis Square
"Cute area"
"Davis Square is a cute little area. It has lots of restaurants and little shops. You can go candlepin bowling, do martial arts, buy cloth diapers, buy toys for your kids, buy ice cream, etc... There's even a gym and CVS there."
Aeronaut Brewing Co.
"Fantastic beer selection."
"My husband and I visited in July. He has a Jackdaw Porter and loved it then had the Dr Nandu pale ale and it was wonderful. $2.50 for a sample and the Porter wad $5 a pint. There was a live jazz band playing. Parking is tight and it's located down a blind alley. No soda or wine available. Just gre..." More >

We even bought some Legos and the prices weren't that bad! One of the Legos we bought came with a coupon for a free admis..." More >
Room Escape Adventures
"We escaped! A great time with no zombie casualties."
"A group of 11 of us attended this event and it was extraordinarily exciting. The experience is really what the event advertises. You get to be locked up in a room for an hour (or less if you succeed) where there is a zombie and lots of puzzles to solve in order to escape. Get touched by the zombie a..." More >
Taza Chocolate Factory Tours
"Nice history of Taza chocolate"
"Very much enjoyed our tour of Taza chocolate factory. Alex did a very nice job of being entertaining and explaining how Taza makes it's unique product. Would recommend it to other chocolate enthusiasts."
Aeronaut Brewing Co.
"Fun place to grab a beer "
"Located in a former envelope factory, this brewery offers a rotating type of interesting, flavorful beers. These brews are not for the faint of heart, they do not neatly fit into categories, with a session beer (Dr Nandau) being the stand out and most notable selection. There is a long backstory..."

Union Square
"Up-and-coming, worth a look."
"This area is still rather funky but is rapidly getting more interesting.

"Martha's Vineyard day trip"
"They picked us up early in the morning, drove to Cape Cod, a little tour and dropped us at the ship. Steve gave us good advice for places to visit in the island. If you like going on your own the public transportation is good, just be concious is not a taxi and some times take longer to go from one..." More >

"Nature amongst highrises"
"An expansive lung space right in the middle of town ! There are events held over the weekends. A perfect place to spend time with family. Children and maybe you would love watching the smart squirrels going about their jobs collecting food from and playing around. "
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
"Like No Other Museum You've Been"
"Beautiful - it will challenge your idea of what makes an artist: One who makes art or one who curates it. I had no expectations walking in and was I blown away. I cannot imagine someone who would not be at least intrigued if not inspired. "

"Beautiful - it will challenge your idea of what makes an artist: One who makes art or one who curates it. I had no expectations walking in and was I blown away. I cannot imagine someone who would not be at least intrigued if not inspired. "
